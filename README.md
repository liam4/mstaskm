# Mobile Shell Task Manager

mstaskm does not have anything to do with Microsoft, nor other trademarked names titled mstaskm, please don't kill me.

I made this in a day to let me have Sublime Text as well as DeSmuMe in splitscreen, while still being able to manage building/testing (using a mobile device, of course!).

## Installation

`git clone`, `npm install`, and `npm link`, in order. I probably forgot to add a dependency to package.json though.

Also I guess you have to do something related to bower to get it working? Because I'm using the `fetch` dependency. I literally learned the basics of bower today though so figure it out yourself.

## Usage

Probably go to the working directory of your project. Create a [tasks.json](https://gist.github.com/liam4/37c95614364d5766a67cee2ae1f179cd) file, then run `mstaskm`.
